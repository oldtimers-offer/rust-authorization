This project is designed to create a robust, secure authorization system built entirely in Rust. It uses the Rocket framework for handling HTTP requests, ensuring fast and safe web interactions. Passwords are securely hashed with Argon2, providing protection against brute-force attacks. For database operations, the project utilizes Diesel to interact with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient and safe storage of user data. The system includes features such as user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control, offering a complete solution for secure user authentication and authorization in modern web applications.
